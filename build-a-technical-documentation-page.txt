          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

          <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
          </ul>

      <section id="What_you_should_already_know" class="main-section">
        <header>What you should already know</header>
          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript</li>
          <ul>
      </section>

       <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello world</header>
          <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
          <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>
          <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
      </section>
     
      <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Variables</header>
          <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
          <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
          <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="Declaring_variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
          <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
          With the keyword var. For example,
          <code>var x = 42.</code>
          <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
<p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
      <code>x = 42.</code>
       <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
<p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
      <code>let y = 13.</code>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
      </section>
     
     <section id="Constants" class="main-section">
        <header>Constants</header>
          <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters</p>
          
          <code>const PI = 3.14;.</code>
          <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
