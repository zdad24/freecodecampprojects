        <p>Cars is a 2006 Pixar animated film about a hotshot rookie race car, Lightning McQueen, who gets stranded in the forgotten town of Radiator Springs on his way to the Piston Cup Championship. While there, he meets a group of quirky residents, including Sally, Mater, and Doc Hudson, and learns about friendship and that winning isn't everything. The movie teaches him to re-evaluate his priorities, and he eventually becomes a changed car by the time he leaves. </p>
